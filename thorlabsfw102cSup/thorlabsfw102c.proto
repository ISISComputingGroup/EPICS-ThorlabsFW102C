# Stream Device Protocol for the Thorlabs Filter Wheel Controller.
# This protocol uses features defined in Stream Device Version 2
#
# Commands and queries from Thorlabs FW102C User Guide - Rev M, October 4, 2023
#
# Command               Syntax      Description
# -------               ------      -----------
# Get ID                *idn?       Returns the model number and firmware version
# Set Position          pos=n       Moves the wheel to filter position n
# Get Position          pos?        Position Query
# Set Position Count    pcount=n    Sets the wheel type where n is 6 or 12
# Get Position Count    pcount?     Returns the wheel type
# Set Trigger Mode      trig=0      Sets the external trigger to the input mode
#                       trig=1      Sets the external trigger to the output mode
# Get Trigger Mode      Trig?       Returns the trigger mode
# Set Speed Mode        speed=0     Sets the move profile to slow speed
#                       speed=1     Sets the move profile to high speed
# Get Speed Mode        speed?      Returns the move profile mode
# Set Sensor Mode       sensors=0   Sensors turn off when wheel is idle to eliminate stray light
#                       sensors=1   Sensors remain active
# Get Sensor Mode       sensors?    Returns the sensor mode
# Set Baud Rate         baud=0      Sets the baud rate to 9600
#                       baud=1      Sets the baud rate to 115200
# Get Baud Rate         baud?       Returns the baud rate where 0 = 9600 and 1 = 115200
# Save Settings         save        This will save all the settings as default on power up
#
# Notes:
#   - Default framing is 115.2 kbaud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no flow control.
# 
#   - The prompt symbol ">" will appear on power-up and after a command is accepted by the
#   FW102C and indicates that the FW102C is ready to receive another command line.
# 
#   - The FW02C is a 6 position filter wheel

OutTerminator     = CR;

replytimeout = 4000;

#
# NOTE: Each read returns the sent query string, too. This is why the
#       input commands need to handle multi line input from the device.
